### NBA Fantasy: Rules and format
In NBA fantasy, ten players are allowed on your roster. You start a lineup of five like a real basketball team. Starters can be adjusted throughout the week.
You must select five frontcourt players and five backcourt players. A salary cap of $100 million is provided, and the cap cannot be exceeded. Only two players can be selected from one NBA team.
Using a lineup of two frontcourt and three backcourt players is possible, or vice versa. You must set your lineup by gameday deadlines. The deadline for each day is 30 minutes before the tipoff of the first game of the night.
The schedule is divided into game weeks. There are 25 weeks in the fantasy season. You are allowed two free transfers to sign and drop players off waivers in a gameweek.
